# Customer-Satisfaction-Statistical-Analysis

📊 **Restaurant Customer Satisfaction Analysis** 📊

I'm excited to share my latest project where I performed a comprehensive statistical analysis of a restaurant customer satisfaction dataset. This project involved:

🔍 **Key Analyses:**
- Testing for differences in satisfaction ratings across various customer groups.
- Examining relationships between categorical variables.
- Measuring correlations between continuous variables.

📈 **Highlights:**
- Found no significant differences in service ratings by gender or preferred cuisine.
- Discovered no significant variance in service ratings between income groups.
- Identified weak and non-significant correlations between age, spending, service ratings, and wait times.

🌟 **Takeaways:**
- Business decisions should focus on areas other than demographic factors, such as enhancing the overall dining experience.
- Further multivariate analyses are recommended for deeper insights.
